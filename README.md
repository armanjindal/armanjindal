# 🌊 Arman Jindal

I'm driven by craft and deep desire to hone skills. Most at home on the server side — working on data pipelines and standing up infrastructure — I love digging deep into problems. Currently, I am leveling up my front-end/product skills and exploring the open world of digital mapping by creating a real-time map of events in NYC for this summer.
