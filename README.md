# 🌊 Arman Jindal

Motivated by digital craft and the vision that technology can connect us more deeply to people, places, the past and the planet, I'm a software engineer by passion and profession. Most at home on the server side, working on data pipelines and standing up infrastructure, that said, I am a full-stack/multistack programmer who focuses on problems rather than tools. Now I am leveling up my front-end skills as I create a real-time map of events in NYC. I am tenacious, coachable, and relentlessly curious, and seeking for a full-time role on a team of ambitious and passionate builders.
