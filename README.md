# 🌊 Arman Jindal

Driven by craft and the belief that technology can connect us more deeply to each other, our past, and our planet, I'm a software engineer by passion and profession. Most at home on the server side — working on data pipelines and standing up infrastructure — I am a full-stack/multistack programmer focused on problems rather than tools. I am leveling up my front-end/product skills by creating a real-time map of events in NYC. I am tenacious, coachable, and relentlessly curious, and I am seeking a full-time role on a team of ambitious builders.
